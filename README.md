# OCDS for GPA

To promote open, fair and transparent competition in government procurement markets, a number of [World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/) (WTO) members negotiated the [Agreement on Government Procurement](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gp_gpa_e.htm) (GPA).

This website provides guidance on how to publish [OCDS](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) data in a way that is consistent with the rules established in the [text of the Agreement](https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/rev-gpr-94_01_e.htm). You may read the guidance in two ways:
